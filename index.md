Hi, I’m **Haripriya Mekala**, a data analyst with a background in **Computer Science**, based in **Atlanta, GA**.  

After completing my bachelor’s degree, I completed an unpaid web development internship, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and designed multiple webpages. To strengthen these skills, I completed the **Meta Front-End Developer** program and earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification. With this foundation, I contributed as a volunteer front-end developer at the **[Nasia Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/nasiafoundation/)**.

During the pandemic, I wanted to expand my career opportunities, which led me to enroll in the **Data Analytics Immersion Bootcamp** with CareerFoundry in Berlin, Germany. Through this program, I worked on a variety of real-world projects and gained hands-on experience with **Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau**.

Outside of analytics, I love **weightlifting** and **running**.
