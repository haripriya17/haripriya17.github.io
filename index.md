After completing my bachelor’s degree, I received an unpaid internship opportunity as a web developer, where I learned **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and designed several webpages. To strengthen these skills, I completed the **Meta Front-End Developer** program and earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification. With this foundation, I contributed as a volunteer front-end developer at the **[Nasia Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/nasiafoundation/)**.

During the pandemic, I wanted to expand my career opportunities, which led me to enroll in the **Data Analytics Immersion Bootcamp** with CareerFoundry in Berlin, Germany. Through this program, I worked on a variety of real-world projects and gained hands-on experience with **Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau**.

Outside of analytics, I enjoy **weightlifting** and **running**, which help me stay disciplined and consistent in my daily routine.
